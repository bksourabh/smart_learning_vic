        { "id": "l4s-q2-d", "text": "Enlargement", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "When a shape moves in a straight line without flipping or turning, it is a **slide (translation)**."

        { "id": "l4s-q3-d", "text": "Straight", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Since $90° < 120° < 180°$, the angle is **obtuse**. Obtuse angles are wider than a right angle but less than a straight angle."

      ],
      "explanation": "In a grid reference, the **letter comes first** and represents the **column**, and the **number comes second** and represents the **row**. So D3 = column D, row 3."

      "explanation": "At $6$ o'clock, the minute hand points to $12$ and the hour hand points to $6$. They point in opposite directions, forming a **straight angle** of $180°$."

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "topic": "grid-references",
      "correctAnswer": "E2",
      "acceptableAnswers": ["E2"],
      "explanation": "Starting at B4: move $3$ columns right from B gives E (B → C → D → E). Move $2$ rows down from 4 gives 2 ($4 - 2 = 2$). New position: **E2**."

      "topic": "angles",
      "correctAnswer": "acute",
      "acceptableAnswers": ["acute", "Acute"],
      "explanation": "Since $45° < 90°$, the angle is **acute**. Acute angles are smaller than a right angle."

      "correctAnswer": "no",
      "acceptableAnswers": ["no", "No", "NO"],
      "explanation": "When a shape is reflected, its size and shape stay exactly the same. Only its orientation (left-right) changes — it becomes a mirror image."
