      "question": "A pencil is 7 paperclips long. A crayon is 5 paperclips long. Which is longer?",
      "difficulty": "easy",

        { "id": "l1m-q1-d", "text": "We cannot tell", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Both are measured with the same unit (paperclips), so we can compare. 7 is more than 5, so the pencil (7 paperclips) is longer than the crayon (5 paperclips)."

      ],
      "explanation": "When the long hand (minute hand) points to 12, it is an o'clock time. The short hand tells us which hour."

      ],
      "explanation": "The long hand on 6 means it is half past. The short hand is between 4 and 5 (closer to 4, heading towards 5), so the hour is 4. It is half past 4."

      ],
      "explanation": "On a balance scale, the side that goes down has the heavier object. The pumpkin side went down, so the pumpkin is heavier than the apple."

        { "id": "l1m-q5-d", "text": "It does not matter", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "If you leave gaps between paperclips, you are counting the space of the gaps too. This makes the object seem longer than it really is, so the measurement would be too big."

      "correctAnswer": "10 o'clock",
      "acceptableAnswers": ["10 o'clock", "10 oclock", "10:00"],
      "explanation": "The long hand on 12 means it is an o'clock time. The short hand on 10 means the hour is 10. So it is 10 o'clock."
